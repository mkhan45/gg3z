Begin Stage Arithmetic:

    Rule Add:
        add(X, Y)
        ---------
        sum(X, Y)

    Rule Multiply:
        mul(X, Y)
        ---------
        product(X, Y)

End Stage Arithmetic

Begin Stage Logic:
    Rule And:
        and(X, Y)
        ---------
        conjunction(X, Y)
End Stage Logic
